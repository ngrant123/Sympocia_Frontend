					1.)What are your tips and tricks for people to get started in writing about video games?
				</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The main thing you need is to be knowledgeable about what you're writing
					about. Always stay up to date with the games and franchises that you're
					interested in so that you can be the one that people come to when they
					want to know something about it. Gaming is so huge nowadays that we all
					have at least one or two franchises that we consider special, so that
					shouldn't be too difficult. Once you've done that, it's easier for you to
					write about it as you don't really need to think too hard about what
					you're going to write about - in fact, more often than not, you may find
					that the words simply flow through you. And once you get the hang of that,
					over time, you become able to write about other things that you may not
					know that much about as well.

					2.) What made you such an avid gamer as opposed to something else? What is it about games that have amazed you?
				</span>
				<br/>
				<br/>

					Gaming has been a part of my life ever since I was very young. This is a
					funny story actually. I must've been about 9-years-old when I caught a
					plane from Athens, Greece all the way to Sydney, Australia with my mother
					and my older sister. Considering this was a flight that went on for over
					20 hours and there wasn't much to do on board, my sister made sure to
					bring lots of things with her to pass the time. So before we left the
					country, she went out and bought a GameBoy with a whole bunch of new
					cassettes (games). While she was sleeping on the plane, I found it and
					started playing and... well, that was pretty much it! After that, I became
					a huge gamer. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The thing I enjoy more about games are their stories and the captivating
					worlds they carry us to. Like, for example, right now I'm playing through the
					Uncharted Collection and I find it fascinating how Nathan Drake goes to all of
					these different places around the world, from Borneo to Shambala to eastern
					France and then Syria... Only video games can create these types of visuals,
					whether they're depicting imaginary worlds or modern day cities and breath
					such life into them.

					3.) Tips for getting better at writing for anyone starting out.
				</span>
				<br/>
				<br/>
			
					 I must've mentioned this in the first question but, you need to give
					 yourself time. There are of course many different writing techniques and
					 if you start working or freelancing, others may ask certain things of you
					 -for example to base your articles around SEOs- but you won't get there
					 from the start. You need to give yourself the room to make mistakes and
					 learn from them so that you can grow as a writer/journalist. 
					 <br/>
					 <br/>
					 <br/>
					Do your research, make sure that what you're writing about is a fact and not
					just some rumor going around online (or if it is a rumor, make sure you tell
					that to your reader), don't be a sensationalist no matter how tempting that
					may be for the clicks and likes, treat your sources with professionalism and
					proofread your own articles to make life easy for your editors. Remember that
					any correction is done to help you improve as a writer, there's nothing
					personal here. Most of the time, these people don't even know you personally. 
 						<br/>
					 <br/>
					 <br/>
					Also be wary of what you post online through your social media if you want to
					become a professional. These things will exist over time and can create a
					negative impact on your public image. Find a good time within the day for you
					to do your writing. It could be in the morning, the afternoon or even after
					hours. No one will judge. And don't judge yourself too hard either.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				<span style={{color:"#5298F8"}}>
					4.) How do you grow your brand as a professional writer and what can you suggest people do?
				</span>
				<br/>
				<br/>

					The only way you can grow is by applying yourself. Write, write and keep
					writing and hope that it leads somewhere. Also, don't be afraid to freelance.
					Right now I'm freelancing for two different websites (Keengamer.com and
					SuperJump) yet still my work is nothing to scoff at. Go online and search for
					gaming websites that are looking for writers (I've written for at least five
					in my career and that's excluding the two I'm working for right now!) I know
					it can seem like a daunting task and even once you get accepted and submit
					your first article, you might get a whole bunch of corrections that make you
					feel as if you totally suck but trust me, that's not the case. You just need
					to keep working at it. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Or, if you feel too overwhelmed by it, you can always let it go and come back
					later. That's the beauty of freelance journalism. You're not tied down by any
					contract, so you're not obligated to do anything. It's all about how much you
					want to make yourself keep going. And if you think that what you're doing
					isn't worth anything, well, let me just tell you that most of the major gaming
					journalists you see on IGN, GameSpot and all those other publications, that's
					how they got started!

					5.)What is your favorite all time game?
				</span>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				To answer this question, I would need to talk first about my all-time
				favorite franchise, which is none other than Final Fantasy. I have a huge
				personal connection with the series, since it helped me make friends when
				I was young and found it hard to make connections due to changing
				countries a lot. It was also one of the things in my life I would always
				have to look forward to and even now I still do with FF XVI. I came into
				the franchise with FF VII, a game that one of my elementary school
				classmates introduced me to, so that game always held a special place in
				my heart. To see it come back to life the way it did last year, through
				Final Fantasy VII Remake, was something that I could've only imagined in
				my dreams and in fact I did dream about for a long, long time. So, for the
				many things that game means to me, there can be no other choice as to
				which my favorite game is, and I will certainly be buying a PlayStation 5
				soon as I anxiously await the next part of the series!
