				<span style={{color:"#5298F8"}}>1.) When did you get started with poetry and what made you fall in love
				with it?</span>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				It goes all the way back to a young child entranced with the rhythm and rhyme
				of Dr. Suess. It was part of my learning to read.  Later in college as part of
				my journalism curriculum I took poetry classes to round out my interests.  I
				think I fell in love with its innate freedom of expression and its powers of
				conveyance through imagery, emotion and experimentation with words.  It was a
				stark contrast to journalistic writing, which in its proper day objectively
				outlined the facts and let the reader form an opinion. Poetry can be anything
				you want in any mode you can fathom.  It's complete freedom of thought and
				expression. I loved the madness of Edgar Allen Poe and the verbiage and
				mystery that is Shakespeare.  


				<br/>
				<br/>
				My early poetry sucked - no other way to put it.  The poems were rhyming
				nightmares.  So I stuck with journalism working for a local newspaper, and
				later moved on to healthcare.  I never really gave it a chance to develop.  As
				a fish out of water must return to its habitat before it dies, I was compelled
				to return to writing and creative ventures, which now included photography -
				another mode of limitless perspective. So I rekindled my love affair with
				poetry, refined my craft, and combined it with photography.  I particularly
				enjoy delving into supernatural waters and unexplained energies and
				connections just outside the grasp of science and reason.

					2.) In your own words how would you explain the power that poetry has and how
					it impacts people?
				</span>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				I think poetry speaks in words that break down walls.  The power of poetry is
				universal language, like music.  It speaks to the heart and soul, as much as
				to the mind.  People seem more open to poetry than an editorial opinionated
				article.  The imagery, metaphors and other literary techniques prompt people
				to think about what is being said, and to consider what the author meant
				before getting caught up in debating the message.  

				<br/>
				<br/>

				First, the reader needs to figure it out.  Try to argue when you don't know
				what you're talking about. This is where the beauty of the magic happens. 
				Sometimes it’s hard to know what is being said if the poem is heavily ladened
				with complex vocabulary and literary hooks.  Poetry innocently guides the
				reader into deep thought, so the reader seeks to first understand what another
				is saying - a component often missing from modern conversation.  


				<br/>
				<br/>
				Second, I think most readers approach poetry with an open mind (if they know
				it’s a poem beforehand) seeking to feed the mind and soul. Even if a reader
				inadvertently stumbles upon a poem, I think the intellectual light switch is
				turned on by the expectation of something different. It can have a profound
				impact on the reader, providing insight, relief and often much-needed emotion.
				In my own experience my most common response has been, “Hmmm, I never thought
				of it that way.”  Poetry is a very powerful tool for enlightenment.

					3.) Tips for writing better poetry for anyone starting out
				</span>
				<br/>
				<br/>
			
				<b>Tip #1 - Resources </b>
				<br/>

				A style book:  Grammar, spelling and etiquette are fundamentals of writing
				regardless of the chosen format.  A style book, such as Strunk & White’s “The
				Elements of Style” (Authored by William Strunk Jr. and E. B White) is a
				quick-read primer on the basics that are often overlooked.  Poetry falls
				outside some of the elements via freedom of form, style and content, but it’s
				a staple resource for someone new to written composition of any kind.  It is
				typically part of a writing curriculum. There are also many poetry handbooks,
				companions and how-tos to help with form and process.



				A thesaurus: helps replace boring words with extraordinary words. 

				A dictionary:  helps define the extraordinary words suggested by the
				thesaurus.

				A rhyming dictionary:  helps find rhyming words of substance, as there is
				nothing worse in poetry than a rhyme just to rhyme. 

				The three above can be either in book format or just via quick online
				searches.  I like Word Hippo online, as it finds synonyms, antonyms,
				definitions, and rhyming words even organized by number of syllables.

				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				<b>Tip #2 - Read, read, and read some more.</b>
				<br/>
				Reading works of other poets will
				inspire, teach and help develop one’s own style.

				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>


				<b>Tip #3 - Write, write, and write some more.</b>
				<br/>
				Practice is the only way through.
				Start by writing - anything. Then follow the tips below to make it a poem.
				Many people journal their random thoughts, every-day experiences or profound
				insights and the feelings associated with each.  Poems can be free verse or
				one-line ramblings or thoughts - so have fun with it.  It's not all stanzas
				and rhymes. Whether you publish it or not the act of writing will make you
				better, and you've already started.

				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>


				<b>Tip #4 - Edit, edit, and edit some more.</b>
				<br/>
				I always say that writing is 10%
				writing and 90% editing.  Just get your thoughts down on paper - no matter how
				bad they sound. Then refine your meaning and delivery.



				Engage the reader with words and form that trigger the reader’s interest and
				feelings.  Be relatable.

				Direct readers where you want them to go - inside the world of your poem.

				Imagine and Inspire by using imagery to transport readers, and language that
				sparks emotion to make them care.

				Tighten by eliminating unnecessary words - make every word count. No
				embellishing just for length. 



				Use these tools to make it shine with creative and engaging verbiage and
				imagery.  Dig deep into your emotions, picture the scene and action, then find
				words, tone and flow that take the reader there.  I sometimes listen to music
				to set a tone, and then turn it off if it becomes distracting.

					4.) Tips for growing your brand as a professional poet
				</span>
				<br/>
				<br/>

					Form your identity before publishing. Know who you are in the narration,
				and what you want to say.  That doesn't mean it's always the same.  That
				doesn't mean the point of view is always the author's.  It just means to
				be authentic and true to the identity.  For example, my last name is
				impossible to remember, so I use my native spirit name as my pen name (or
				pseudonym) for poetry.  I also do freelance work other than poetry under a
				different name, as this work does not necessarily fit the theme and
				personality of Aiyanah and what she wants to convey.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				Look for venues and publications that fit your piece, and choose publishers
				and publishing space wisely.  Not every piece is for every publication.  And
				you don't want to write for every publication - trust me on this.  In online
				space, interact with others! That means reading their works as well,
				commenting and following if your goal is to grow readership.  Be sure to be
				genuine.  When you interact, doors open and great experiences happen to make
				you better.  Even if it’s just a quick exchange.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				Most importantly, write for the love of writing or because you have something
				to say in your own special way.  Let that be the reward for writing.  Money
				comes from doing your best at something you're passionate about.  If you
				aren't passionate about the subject, write about something else.  Readers know
				the difference.  In terms of generating income from writing, plan to branch
				out in terms of venues, projects and collaborations for different sources of
				income and exposure.  Sometimes you publish to get exposure, especially in the
				beginning.  But your excitement and enthusiasm shining through from the love
				of your work is what develops a following.

					5.) What was your inspiration for creating your poem the Bridge
				</span>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				This one was a special one.  Actually, the special one is normally the one I’m
				working on at the moment.  But this poem is rooted in my childhood.

				<br/>
				<br/>

				When I was around 10 I took a family vacation to Parke County Indiana to
				attend an annual event called the Covered Bridge Festival.  Self-proclaimed
				the “Covered Bridge Capital of the World” by its founders, the county
				celebrates with an annual 10-day festival during fall peak color and harvest
				season. Travelers book campsites almost a year in advance to meander through
				39 covered bridges and more than 80 cemeteries (if you dare).  The foliage and
				historical treasure is some of the best in the country.  Local residents of
				each town hosted outdoor festivals with foods, displays, and periodic dress of
				pilgrim days, such as stew cooked in huge cauldrons over an open fire,
				homemade sassafras in wooden barrels and a blacksmith presentation.

				<br/>
				<br/>

				The history and mystique of the rustic bridges and their surroundings was
				mesmerizing, as we drove through the dark, creaky structures.  I often later
				thought of travelers and dwellers passing through, pondering their challenges
				and experiences.  This year I returned to re-experience the mystery and spent
				some time at this particular site, and the mystery of nature’s energies and
				its timeless connection inspired the poem.  The words are what flowed through.
