Who does this asshole think he is? </span><span className="c4">The audacity.</span><span className="c5 c6">&nbsp;How can he say such a thing? Not made to be an employee? I’m calling ICE and getting him deported.</span></p><p className="c1"><span className="c2">Chapter 1: Tensions boiling</span></p><p className="c1"><span className="c5">Now hold on for just a second. That title above isn’t made in a way to imply that I’m better than anyone. </span><span className="c4">Matter of fact I’m worse than a large majority of people and I take pride in that, to be honest.</span><span className="c5 c6">&nbsp;I’ve tried to be an employee and it always ends in one way. Me getting tired of being ordered around and working on something that I have completely zero interest in whatsoever. It happened at my last job and my previous jobs before that. This continuous cycle is going to happen forever and ever, unfortunately. Let me tell you how it all started</span></p><p className="c1"><span className="c2">Chapter 2: The journey</span></p><p className="c1"><span className="c5">I was working at a startup making a luxurious $0.00 an hour as an intern and I was honestly living the high life. It was my first internship and I didn’t know what to expect so I was excited.</span><span className="c4">&nbsp;I was tasked with helping the lead engineer in making their project while he was on “vacation” and I was ecstatic</span><span className="c5 c6">. But that excitement slowly but surely dwindled away. This can’t be it right?</span></p><span style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', WebkitTransform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', width: '624.00px', height: '413.33px'}}><img alt="Image for post" src={Image1} style={{width: '100%', height: '100%', marginLeft: '0.00px', marginTop: '0.00px', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', WebkitTransform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)'}} title /></span><p className="c1"><span className="c5">I had no motivation in what I was doing because honestly it wasn’t my baby at all. </span><span className="c4">Then the final straw happened. </span><span className="c5">There I was sitting there coding away and one of my “senior” colleagues asked me a question. You want to know what that question was? “Hey Nathan, can you please walk down to the copy machine and get me something?” There it was. The one line I dreaded hearing. I’m all for being a team player don’t get me wrong but honestly… you got legs don’t you? I hated knowing that my position in the company was an engineer and also a paper boy. I hated knowing that I was expendable just because someone told me I am, no matter how many hours I put into the product. So what did I do? </span><span className="c2">Nothing they let me go later</span></p><p className="c1"><span className="c2">Conclusion:</span></p><p className="c1"><span className="c5">Maybe you’re reading this and you’re disgusted (not at me hopefully). Maybe you’re in the same predicament. Let me tell you…. Once I started working on Sympocia everything has just gotten better tremendously. </span><span className="c2">So what are you waiting for?</span></p><p className="c1"><span className="c5 c6">Having said that there’s a hugggee possibility my platform won’t blow up sooo..check it out?</span></p><p className="c1"><span className="c7"><a className="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sympocia.com/&sa=D&ust=1607451223900000&usg=AOvVaw2_8DA4c942r11kS6RU2FpU">https://sympocia.com/</a></span></p><p className="c1"><span className="c5 c6">It’s free forever :)</span></p><p className="c10"><span className="c3" /></p>
